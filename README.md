Read Me:

I'm Amanda. I'm interested in crochet and sewing.
I'm currently learning about different online businesses.
I am a Sophomore in Computer Engineering.
I chose my major because it challenges and interests me.
A fun fact about me: I can make a really good cup of coffee.
I'm not sure what I want to learn from EE 205, but GitHub is a
really good start.
I recommend the movie Big Fish.
